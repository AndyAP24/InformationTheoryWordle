If we generate a distribution, after we guess and get a pattern can we just guess the next most
informative word that is still compatible, or does the distribution's "ranking" change?

Should we be iterating over the guesses and word/pattern pairs and computing the size
of the pruned dictionary? Or should we be solving the optimization problem as stated
by Task 5?

In either case, does pre-computing and storing info factor into the solution?
